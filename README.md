Scrapers
========

A collection of scrapers to fetch various bits and bobs from the web.

Each folder contains a different scraper and a sample of it's output. In each 
case information about the scraper can be found in the comments at the top of 
the file.

You will need **nokogiri** and **open-uri** gems to run these.

    > gem install nokogiri open-uri

Then run like this:

    > ruby google_scraper.rb
